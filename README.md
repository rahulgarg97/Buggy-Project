# Buggy-Project
Silver Challenge: The challenge included moving a single buggy on the defined track with predefined events and conditions. The buggy that started once should not involve any human interface during full round of defined challenge. This challenge required IR sensor so that our buggy could follow the black strip and move in anticlockwise direction. The buggy had to move from the parking area and complete three rounds and count 9 obstacles in its way using ultrasonic sensor. As soon as the counter is updated at 9 it should come in the parking area.

Challenge Gold: This challenge included moving two buggies on the defined track with predefined events and conditions. Also the buggies should communicate among themselves through Xbee under half duplex mode. The buggy once started should not involve any human interface during full round of defined challenge. This challenge required communication through zigbee. As soon as the previous buggy came at the parking area it should signal another buggy. Now this buggy should move in opposite
direction and repeat the same procedure followed by buggy1.
